# demo-svc - Simple REST Api + CLI Application

## Design Decision

For the REST api server the state of the application is stored as Clojure atom.

See `people-db` atom in code. In real world application this would have been stored in
the database like PostgreSQL.

Thus the data will not be saved when the server is re-started.

The system is currently determine the type of input using the extension for API code.
e.g. It will only take in the file that have `*.csv`, `*.space`, and `*.piped` via `upload` end-point.


The system will be skipping invalid input and only logs the result to the console if such input line is found.

On the server the logs will be something like:

```
[main] INFO net.b12n.demo-svc.server - server running on port 3000
[qtp1205543136-21] INFO net.b12n.demo-svc.server - File saved to : /home/b12n/codes/demo-svc/uploads/data-with-invalid-lines.csv
[qtp1205543136-21] WARN net.b12n.demo-svc.server - Skipping this line as it is not valid input : Johnson,Josh,M,Blue,06/18/19XX
[qtp1205543136-21] WARN net.b12n.demo-svc.server - Reason: "06/18/19XX" - failed: valid-date? in: [4] at: [:date-of-birth] spec: :net.b12n.demo-svc.core/date-of-birth

[qtp1205543136-21] WARN net.b12n.demo-svc.server - Skipping this line as it is not valid input : Barry,Jane,X,Pink,07/18/1950
[qtp1205543136-21] WARN net.b12n.demo-svc.server - Reason: "X" - failed: valid-gender? in: [2] at: [:gender] spec: :net.b12n.demo-svc.core/gender
```

## Development/Build

Run server using the script `./run-server`

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
## Run live server - required for integration test
set -eo pipefail
lein run -m net.b12n.demo-svc.server
```

Then run basic tests via `./run-test-with-code-coverage`

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eo pipefail
## Note: must start system first via $lein run
## as this will run regular test + integration tests which require live server to be up
lein cloverage -p src -s test -n net\.b12n\.demo-svc\.*
```

Which should produce result similar to:

```

### CLI usage

The CLI application will take input from the command line and print the result on the screen.

First build the self-executable binary using [lein-binplus](https://github.com/BrunoBonacci/lein-binplus) plugins

```sh
lein bin
```

This should give you the following output

```
## ... more logs, omitted for brevity
## ...
Created /home/b12n/codes/demo-svc/target/demo-svc-cli-1.0.0-standalone.jar
Creating standalone executable: /home/b12n/codes/demo-svc/target/srk
Re-aligning zip offsets
Copying binary to .
```

As a result we should have the self-executable `./srk` at the root of the project.

To start using this we can simply run the following command

```sh
./srk -h
```

This should print the following output to the screen:

```
srk - Simple Record Keeper library

Usage:
  srk [--input-file=<input-file> --file-type=<file-type> | --help ]

Options:
  -i, --input-file=<input-file>  Input file to use [default: data.csv]
  -t, --file-type=<file-type>    File type (one of csv, piped, and space) [default: csv]
  -h, --help                     Print this usage

  Example Usage:
  # a) Load input file of type 'csv' to the system
  srk -i ./resources/data.csv -t csv

  # b) Load input file of type 'piped' to the system
  srk -i ./resources/data.piped -t piped

  # c) Load input file of type 'space' to the system
  srk -i ./resoures/data.space -t space

  # c) Show help
  srk -h
```

Example Output: using `./resources/data-with-invalid-lines.csv`

Then we can use this to run the main CLI application

```
./srk -i ./resources/data-with-invalid-lines.csv -t csv

### REST API usage via Swagger

To see the result quickly try this via Swagger UI

Start the server (default to port `3000` on localhost)

```
./run-server
```

Then open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Since you just started you will need to populate the internal data using `

- [POST : records/upload](http://localhost:3000/index.html#/records/post_records_upload) endpoint

Select the file [resources/data-with-invalid-lines.csv](https://github.com/burinc/demo-svc/blob/main/resources/data-with-invalid-lines.csv)

This file contains 6 sample line of data 2 of which are invalid.

For pipe-delimited input file you can use

- [resources/data.piped](https://github.com/burinc/demo-svc/blob/main/resources/data.piped).

And for space-delimited input file you can use

- [resources/data.space](https://github.com/burinc/demo-svc/blob/main/resources/data.space).

Then you can see list of data via [GET records/](http://localhost:3000/index.html#/records/get_records_)

Also you can try other end-points from the following list:

- [GET : records/birthdate](http://localhost:3000/index.html#/records/get_records_birthdate)
- [GET : records/firstname](http://localhost:3000/index.html#/records/get_records_firstname)
- [GET : records/gender](http://localhost:3000/index.html#/records/get_records_gender)
- [GET : records/lastname](http://localhost:3000/index.html#/records/get_records_lastname)

And you can also clear records using

- [DELETE : records/](http://localhost:3000/index.html#/records/delete_records_)

To add just a single record you can use

- [POST : record](http://localhost:3000/index.html#/records/post_records_) end-point.

The payload should be something like valid json e.g.

```json
{
  "last-name": "Smith",
  "first-name": "John",
  "gender": "M",
  "fav-color": "Green",
  "date-of-birth": "02/18/1980"
}
```

The only two fileds that you need to be aware of are `gender` and `date-of-birth`

If you supply the invalid payload then you will see something like:

```clojure
{
  "data": {
    "last-name": "string",
    "first-name": "string",
    "date-of-birth": "string",
    "fav-color": "string",
    "gender": "string"
  },
  "err": "\"string\" - failed: valid-gender? in: [2] at: [:gender] spec: :net.b12n.demo-svc.core/gender\n"
}
```
Or if all other fields are valid, except the `date-of-birth` you should get something like

```clojure
{
  "data": {
    "last-name": "Posh",
    "first-name": "Jenny",
    "date-of-birth": "10/02/20XX",
    "fav-color": "Green",
    "gender": "F"
  },
  "err": "\"10/02/20XX\" - failed: valid-date? in: [4] at: [:date-of-birth] spec: :net.b12n.demo-svc.core/date-of-birth\n"
}
```
